=====================

Simulating the Monty Hall Problem
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

As exposed on http://www.ai-class.com/

On this simulation the player always picks
door number 0 and then randomly chooses to keep
or switch doors after all but one - plus the first 
one - of the remaining doors are opened, never
showing the prize

UPDATE: no more fixed initial selection

The total wining rounds are computed taking in
consideration the choice of keeping or switching
doors.
